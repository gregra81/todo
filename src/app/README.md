# The `src/app` Directory

## Overview

```
src/
  |- app/
  |  |- todo/
  |  |- app.js
  |  |- app.spec.js
```

The `src/app` directory contains all code specific to this application. Apart
from `app.js` and its accompanying tests (discussed below), this directory is
filled with subdirectories corresponding to high-level sections of the
application, often corresponding to top-level routes. Each directory can have as
many subdirectories as it needs, and the build system will understand what to
do. For example, a top-level route might be "products", which would be a folder
within the `src/app` directory that conceptually corresponds to the top-level
route `/list`, though this is in no way enforced. Products may then have
subdirectories for "create", "view", "search", etc. The "view" submodule may
then define a route of `/task/:id`, ad infinitum.
